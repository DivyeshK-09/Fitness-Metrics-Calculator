# 🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Metrics Calculator

A research-backed, science-driven fitness metrics web app built with **Streamlit** and **Python**. Calculates BMI, BMR, RMR, TDEE, goal-specific macronutrients, fiber, and daily micronutrient targets — all from peer-reviewed sports nutrition guidelines.

## ✨ Features

- **BMI** — WHO standard formula with category label (Underweight / Normal / Overweight / Obese)
- **BMR** — Estimated as 90% of RMR (display reference only — not used in any calculations)
- **RMR** — Mifflin-St Jeor (1990), drives all downstream calculations
- **TDEE** — RMR × validated activity multipliers
- **Target Calories** — ±500 kcal surplus/deficit based on goal
- **Macronutrients** — Goal-aware (Gain Mass / Maintain / Lose Fat), activity-scaled, always sums to target calories
  - **Protein** — ISSN-backed g/kg ranges, higher on cut to preserve lean mass, lower on bulk
  - **Fats** — Fixed per activity level (1.0–1.15 g/kg), goal-independent for hormonal stability
  - **Carbs** — Pure caloric remainder, floored at 0g
  - **Fiber** — IOM standard: 14g per 1000 kcal, displayed as subset of carbs
- **Micronutrients** — ICMR-NIN 2020 RDA base values, activity-bumped for Iron, Magnesium, Zinc, B-Vitamins, Vitamin C, D, Potassium and Sodium
- **PDF Report** — Downloadable full report with all metrics, macros, fiber, vitamins and minerals

## 📋 Supported Input Units

| Measurement | Supported Units |
|---|---|
| Weight | kg, lbs, stones (st), ounces (oz) |
| Height | cm, meters (m), feet+inches (ft) e.g. 5'11 |
| Age | Years |

All inputs are converted to **kg** and **cm** before any formula is applied.

---

## 🎯 Goals Supported

| Goal | Calorie Adjustment | Protein | Fats | Carbs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **GAIN MASS** | TDEE + 500 kcal | Lower — surplus supports muscle growth | Fixed per activity | Remainder |
| **MAINTAIN** | TDEE | Moderate | Fixed per activity | Remainder |
| **LOSE FAT** | TDEE − 500 kcal | Higher — preserves lean mass in deficit | Fixed per activity | Remainder |

---

## 🏃‍♂️ Activity Levels

| Level | Description | TDEE Multiplier |
|---|---|---|
| Sedentary | Little/no exercise, basic household activity | 1.2 |
| Lightly Active | Yoga, brisk walking 4–5 kmph (45–60 mins) | 1.375 |
| Moderate | Casual sports, light weights, jogging (60–90 mins) | 1.55 |
| Active | Weight training, calisthenics, competitive sports (120–150 mins, 3–5 days) | 1.725 |
| Very Active | Intense training, high-volume workouts (150+ mins, 6–7 days) | 1.975 |

---

## 📊 Macro Logic

| Macro | Approach |
|---|---|
| **Fats** | Fixed g/kg by activity level — 1.0g/kg (Sedentary–Moderate), 1.1g/kg (Active), 1.15g/kg (Very Active). Goal-independent to protect hormonal health |
| **Protein** | g/kg multiplier varies by both activity level and goal. Cut > Maintain > Bulk at every activity level |
| **Carbs** | Pure caloric remainder: `(target_cal - protein×4 - fats×9) / 4` |
| **Fiber** | `target_cal / 1000 × 14g` — scales naturally with calorie intake |

---

## 🔬 Micronutrient Approach

Base values from **ICMR-NIN 2020 RDA**, sex-differentiated. Activity-level bumps applied to:

| Micronutrient | Reason for bump |
|---|---|
| Vitamin C | Oxidative stress from exercise |
| Vitamin D | Indoor training limits sunlight |
| Iron | Sweat loss, high-intensity hemolysis |
| Magnesium | Sweat loss, 300+ enzymatic reactions under load |
| Zinc | Sweat loss, protein turnover |
| B1, B2, B3, B6 | Energy metabolism scales with training intensity |
| Potassium & Sodium | Direct electrolyte sweat losses |

All other micros stay at base RDA regardless of activity.
