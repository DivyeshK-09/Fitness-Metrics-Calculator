## ✨ Features

- **BMI** — WHO standard formula with category label (Underweight / Normal / Overweight / Obese)
- **BMR** — Estimated as 90% of RMR (display reference only — not used in any calculations)
- **RMR** — Mifflin-St Jeor (1990), drives all downstream calculations
- **TDEE** — RMR × validated activity multipliers
- **Target Calories** — ±500 kcal surplus/deficit based on goal
- **Macronutrients** — Goal-aware (Gain Mass / Maintain / Lose Fat), activity-scaled, always sums to target calories
  - **Protein** — ISSN-backed g/kg ranges, higher on cut to preserve lean mass, lower on bulk
  - **Fats** — Fixed per activity level (1.0–1.15 g/kg), goal-independent for hormonal stability
  - **Carbs** — Pure caloric remainder, floored at 0g
  - **Fiber** — IOM standard: 14g per 1000 kcal, displayed as subset of carbs
- **Micronutrients** — ICMR-NIN 2020 RDA base values, activity-bumped for Iron, Magnesium, Zinc, B-Vitamins, Vitamin C, D, Potassium and Sodium
- **PDF Report** — Downloadable full report with all metrics, macros, fiber, vitamins and minerals

## 📋 Supported Input Units

| Measurement | Supported Units                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Weight      | kg, lbs, stones (st), ounces (oz)          |
| Height      | cm, meters (m), feet+inches (ft) e.g. 5'11 |
| Age         | Years                                      |

## 🎯 Goals Supported

| Goal          | Calorie Adjustment | Protein                                 | Fats               | Carbs     |
| ------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| **GAIN MASS** | TDEE + 500 kcal    | Lower — surplus supports muscle growth  | Fixed per activity | Remainder |
| **MAINTAIN**  | TDEE               | Moderate                                | Fixed per activity | Remainder |
| **LOSE FAT**  | TDEE − 500 kcal    | Higher — preserves lean mass in deficit | Fixed per activity | Remainder |

## 🏃‍♂️ Activity Levels

| Level          | Description                                                                | TDEE Multiplier |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Sedentary      | Little/no exercise, basic household activity                               | 1.2             |
| Lightly Active | Yoga, brisk walking 4–5 kmph (45–60 mins)                                  | 1.375           |
| Moderate       | Casual sports, light weights, jogging (60–90 mins)                         | 1.55            |

## 📊 Macro Logic

| Macro       | Approach                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fats**    | Fixed g/kg by activity level — 1.0g/kg (Sedentary–Moderate), 1.1g/kg (Active), 1.15g/kg (Very Active). Goal-independent to protect hormonal health |
| **Protein** | g/kg multiplier varies by both activity level and goal. Cut > Maintain > Bulk at every activity level                                              |
| **Carbs**   | Pure caloric remainder: `(target_cal - protein×4 - fats×9) / 4`                                                                                    |
| **Fiber**   | `target_cal / 1000 × 14g` — scales naturally with calorie intake                                                                                   |

## 🔬 Micronutrient Approach

Base values from **ICMR-NIN 2020 RDA**, sex-differentiated. Activity-level bumps applied to:

| Micronutrient      | Reason for bump                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Vitamin C          | Oxidative stress from exercise                   |
| Vitamin D          | Indoor training limits sunlight                  |
| Iron               | Sweat loss, high-intensity hemolysis             |
| Magnesium          | Sweat loss, 300+ enzymatic reactions under load  |
| Zinc               | Sweat loss, protein turnover                     |
| B1, B2, B3, B6     | Energy metabolism scales with training intensity |
| Potassium & Sodium | Direct electrolyte sweat losses                  |

All other micros stay at base RDA regardless of activity.
